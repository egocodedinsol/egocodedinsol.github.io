The recent Yahoo t-shirt debacle highlights an issue with gift economies. They
depend on reciprocity, which generates feelings of entitlement almost by
construction.  This is an important example, because massive
open source repositories like GitHub, and open exchanges like StackOverflow
have made gift markets easier to do at scale and distance. More interestingly,
gift economies seem reinforced not by the people doing the giving, but by the
public at large. If a giver doesn't feel adequately reciprocated, often they
simply stop giving. 

Imagine Alice spends 8 hours fixing Bob's computer, and Bob makes her an
absolutely fantastic dinner to thank her. But when Charlie fixes Dino's
computer, Dino says "thanks dude, high five!" Charlie thinks "Dino might not
value my work very much." Of course Dino was under no legal requirement, but
the obligation was still oddly set by the way Alice/Bob behaved in the gift
economy. 

To many it "feels wrong" even if they are mere observers. Dino might say "so
entitled!" and that's true - that's the whole way that gift economies seem to
work, by creating an expectation of reciprocity. When that expectation -
however logical or justified - is not met, people get upset. Oddly, it is very
difficult to avoid an entrenched gift economy without incurring public shame.
(insert speculations on evolutionary psych).
