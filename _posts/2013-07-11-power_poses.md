When you speak about events as if you have no control over them, you're already
taking yourself out of the system. 

There are three really important considerations here:

First, cultural differences in body language meaning and interpretation can be
crucial, especially since their effect is so subtle and difficult to control.
In some cultures, for instance, looking someone in the eye when they admonish
you is a sign of respect, in others, it's a sign of insolence. Bear in mind
that when someone's yelling at you they probably won't be thinking "maybe my
interpretations of body language aren't the same as this person's" and even if
it does cross their mind it might not overcome their first reaction.

Second, always choosing "the power pose" can be really detrimental. Consider
the position of the dude leaning back with his legs crossed and his hands
behind his head. Now imagine that you're helping him print "Hello, World!" in
C. At this point I would strongly consider advising him to go to the command
line and type "rm -rf /". When people ask me for help but their body language
says "I'm not grateful" I feel used. I don't like to feel used, so I go out of
my way to cut them off.

Third, these studies are great, and they give great data on *short-term*
interactions. Posing powerfully before you go into a short job interview can
help you get the job. But consider that over the long term you might alienate
yourself from your colleagues by consistently going for the power pose. Yes,
it's a useful signal of confidence for an interview, but *if you can't back it
up* over the long-term, you're going to be worse than someone who looks
unconfident, you're going to be labeled as a poser. Imagine leaning-back-dude
smugly proclaiming that he's an "uber-hacker-ninja" because he printed the
contents of an array "yeah, that's right, hackin' into the c++". That only
works when you actually know more than anyone else.

We've all been around people like this, and sometimes it works out. Some people
pose confidently and that helps them demonstrate nonverbally that they're
really good, and it's okay because they are. But some people think they're the
shiznit and then can't get the subplot function to work in matlab. These people
may have gotten the job, but they won't get cool projects, great
recommendations, or lasting relationships unless they dramatically change their
attitude or their expertise.

Finally, a word on how these effects vary from field to field. In a job where
your performance is not easily measurable, these effects can do well. But even
in fields where projecting confidence is important, projecting them to the
wrong person when your performance is measurable can be bad. Imagine someone in
sales. They *should* project confidence to their clients. Now imagine someone
in sales hasn't been selling well. In speaking to their boss, should they
strike a confident pose and lean back like it's summer barbecue time?
