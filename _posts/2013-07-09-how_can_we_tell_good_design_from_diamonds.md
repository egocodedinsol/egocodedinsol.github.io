It's not hard to criticize trendy-trends as foolish expenditures. "You fools!
You bought into that stupid hype!" And it's not new to suggest that humans
follow trends. It's not even particularly surprising to note that the ability
to follow trends can incur a significant advantage to an individual in terms of
status, or general assumed level of social fluency. 

To make matters complicated, some trends have real substance. Unfortunately, we
conceptualize real substance and empty trends the same way. If you listen to
diamond experts, they can talk your ears off earnestly about how awesome
diamonds are, how beautiful the most beautiful ones are. If you ask Scotch
fans, they will detail all the beautiful points of an Islay compared to a
Highland. Lagavulin.  No, no, the mythical Lagavulin 21! Peated just so with
seaweed, aged in the blah-blah casks[^1]. You get the picture. 

I'd like to think I appreciate nice things. But it's difficult to understand
what I appreciate because it's well-marketed versus what I appreciate because
it's good design. 

It gets worse: the "fictive" enjoyment we get from things like diamonds, whose
value (aside from price-fixing) was created by advertising agencies is actually
real. We might convince ourselves that we're above such frivolity, but not
everyone we
love will feel the same way. Yes, we could only choose friends and
lovers without frivolous taste, but there are a thousand things to choose by,
and a love of diamonds is hardly the litmus test for friendship. 

Once we make that concession, we're doomed to perpetuate it. If we believe the price of a
woman's love to be a diamond, we reinforce that by buying one. Not only in the
"the more people do something the more accepted it is" sense, but the fact that
the more people meet an expectation, the lower the bar is seen, and not
"meeting' that bar spikes the prior for you not having the right stuff.

It has a somewhat similar analogy to a college diploma. The cost of not having
one rises as more people obtain it. Perhaps at some point a threshold is
crossed, in which not having a college diploma is seen as avant-garde. In some
places this no doubt works: one can swap or postpone a college cap for a
credential of a different kind: a Thiel Fellowship, a startup, something
awesome enough that I couldn't point to an example of it. 

All of these trappings - diamonds, diplomas, and a refined whisky palate - still
depend on social context, because society dictates the rewards you get from
acquiring them. Even if you wanted to distinguish good design from diamonds in
most things we value, it would be impossible. We want social validation more
than anything once we have food and shelter, and most well-designed objects
therefore give us social validation as a primary benefit[^2]. The social
validation doesn't ever even have to actually occurr. Just owning an object, or
belonging to an organization, or doing a deed that I believe would bring praise
grants a benefit.

"Wow, what a downer, dude." Sort of. I advocate a stronger
form of individualism. 

And here is the internet.  It seems sometimes that everyone is shouting what to
do, but this is the ruse. All you have to do is convince someone what to
want, and feeding them what to do is simple. It's not simple because
people are dumb, but because they're smart. If they know what they want,
they're find ways to make it happen. The catch is that convincing someone to
want something <em>is</em> hard, especially when others are convincing them to
want something else. It remains to be seen whether the plethora of online
opinions will converge to some reddit-like front-page document of What to Want.

On the one hand, attaching numbers to readership, voting on comments, following
a few prominent people on twitter, can lead to a mindless but intense focal
point, like so many army ants devouring leaf after leaf in the infinite forest
of ideas. But on the other, getting to secluded lagoons in the forest has never
been easier, and finding a small group to go there with you is limited only by
picking them out of the crowd. 

It's hard to be different, though. Not hard in the "wow, you're such a tough
cowboy, acting exactly the way a cowboy ought to," that smirk-inducing "hard"
when a celebrity takes a few hours to speak at a rally before flying home to
party and everyone swoons and calls for more leaders to boldly take us into the
mild[^3]. It's hard in the way of actual unpopularity, of never being cool
until maybe you're old, of not combing your hair, or combing your hair when
you're not supposed to. It's hard because we want social validation, and
because being different in a meaningful way will more often than not incur a
social cost that will bring net detriment to your happiness if you still want
the same things as everyone else.

In Office Space, one dude asks another "what would you do if you had a million
dollars" and another responds with something like "dude, it's a stupid question
anyway, if everyone did that no one would work at the land fill". In truth,
people choose remarkably similar things, and that's the real tragedy.

So why be different? Ironically, I'm suggesting we choose paths that
are different because the more often we do, the better the benefit for society,
even if it's worse for you in the long run. This might sound a little bit like a
kindergarten teacher explaining to the class that everyone should be themselves.
Yes. But more than that, we should actively shape ourselves to want different
things. There should be less "want what I want, or you're weird" and more
"please, don't want what I want." 

It might be that the only way to distinguish good design from diamonds is to
lower the compounding effect of social validation. 

[^1]: (1) I really do enjoy Scotch. The Lagavulin is incredible.
But then, I want to enjoy it. 

[^2]: (2) Assuming you design things to give people what they want, as opposed to
what they need. I'm not David Foster Wallace so I won't write another essay
about that in this footnote.  

[^3]: (3) I don't object to celebrities taking a few hours to speak at a rally before
flying home to party. It's the swooning and calling for more leaders to boldy
take us into the mild I smirk at.
