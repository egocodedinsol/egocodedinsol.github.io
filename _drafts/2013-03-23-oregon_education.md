Linus recently wrote about school choice in his school district. I understand
his concern, because I went to public school near where Linus lives. I also
understand the desire to transfer schools or districts because I did it.  I
was supposed to go to one school (which Jen-Hsun Huang attended) but went to
another because of certain academic advantages including an exceptional
faculty. My high-school physics teacher had a PhD in chemistry and worked in
industry for many years. My English teacher also had a PhD. Many parents
worked for Intel or Nike. Engineers taught us mathematics in elementary
school, and art-lovers showed us pictures of the Sistine Chapel. 

Education was important. He correctly points out "But you do also end up being
in a community where people care about education, so it's not just the school:
it's the whole environment around you and your kids." This was reflected in
the other kids I was surrounded with. When we didn't have a coach for our
debate team, one kid went and found one. Marching band was cool. Emphatically,
I do not mean that the children were more intelligent. Instead, I mean that
they believed education was important and they knew they could work with the
system to meet their needs.
