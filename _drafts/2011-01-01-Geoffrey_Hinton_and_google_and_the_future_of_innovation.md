Before we lament, consider that Google's research budget will apparently be twice that of DARPA. 

There are all the obvious implications of that budget, but the most specific (to which Hinton refers) is very large-scale computation. 

The other interesting implication is the possibility of bringing together great people for a specific purpose. Universities tend to have researchers in a single department focus on orthogonal interests, perhaps for the better. A corporation with a specific goal can avoid this problem. 

If we want to see Peter-Thiel-innovation (however that's defined), perhaps focus and resources at places like Google is a good thing?
