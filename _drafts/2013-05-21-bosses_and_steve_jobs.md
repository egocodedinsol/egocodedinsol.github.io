Rather than discussing whether this particular person was an ass, maybe we can
ask what the most effective methods of motivation are in addition to treating
people with respect and being nice. What was it about someone that helped you
do such awesome things that you looked back and said "I had no idea I was
  capable of that!"

I'll start with a former boss of mine. Every time I had a problem with some
data analysis, I would walk into his office and I'd invariably leave with
clarity. He wasn't technically proficient, but he knew when I had asked the
wrong question or tried solving the wrong problem. He never told me how to do
something. Instead he always seemed to know what questions I should be asking
to know what I wanted to know.

After a few months, I could say "I solved that problem? I didn't even know it
*was* a problem a week ago."

It was not that this individual was better than me at coding, it was that he
was better at *articulating* higher-level concepts.
