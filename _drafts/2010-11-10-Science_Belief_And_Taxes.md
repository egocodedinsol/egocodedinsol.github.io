The scariest part isn't what it says about TEDx per se, but about society in
general. This guy sounds reasonably intelligent if you tune out and ignore his
words. 

And listening to the words, I notice that my disagreement is in large part
social. If someone were to ask me how I know the speed of light hasn't changed
since 1945 I would reply that smart people I trust tell me so. (Yes, yes, I
know the speed of light is constant in a vacuum, relative to whatever suitable
reference frame you like. This postulate gives us special relativity. But this
doesn't prove that c hasn't changed.)

I'm more qualified to judge that his science is bunk, but what about when
people speak of other things I don't usually understand. For instance, I don't
know much about cryptography. I'm totally dependent on others there. Colin
Percival were to call me up and suggest I just use XOR with 1111 on all my
files, I really wouldn't be able to argue with him. 

Then the worst part gets to social phenomena in which the Right Answer is very
difficult to quantify. We get wonderfully precise measurements of *c*. We get
horribly imprecise measurements of how tax policy affects net wealth, or
whether a particular bailout strategy was effective.

So when someone confidently stands up and proclaims x,y,z about taxes, how am I
supposed to argue against it, except to say that other confident people stood
up and said otherwise?
