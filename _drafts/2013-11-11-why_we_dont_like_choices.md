I'm not sure why we don't like choices, or why more hcoice seems bad. 

This is more than just "information overload." 

When lego adds new parts, we get upset. Why? If the same sets and more that were available are available now, why does it matter? 

On the one hand, it's tempting to say "Lego doesn't make _sets_ anymore, they just make figurines that fall apart easily"

But if they're making that AND the usual, what's the difference?
