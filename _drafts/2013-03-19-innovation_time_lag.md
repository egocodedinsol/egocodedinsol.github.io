Innovation sometimes requires a period of experimentation before big time. 

Bitcoin has a market cap right now of approx half of what Instagram sold for
at the time of its sale. The technology that made building Instagram possible
in a year was forged over a longer period. 

Personal computing required a few years of messing around. 

The Internet required a while. 

Is there a time-lag between lots of people building up an ecosystem and
institutional knowledge before it's ripe for moneying? 

Even with personal computing, the joke used to be that the efficiency was
everywhere but labor productivity statistics. 


Movements vs products: 

My favorite perspective on this comes from a friend who as talking about 3d
printing and DIY bio (he owns a 3d printer and does DIY bio in addition to
working in a traditional lab). He reminded me that at level you need a
movement, more than some specific product like a better 3d printer. 

The other thing I remembered is that "movements" like personal computing and
the internet really were black swans in the original sense of the term. The
internet would have been hard to have foreseen before personal computers were
ubiquitous. facebook. Etc. 

"search" mobile, etc. Fund things that represent a movement more than a
specific product, perhaps more than a market. What's the best way to predict
the future? invent it. what't the best way to invent the future? Make a
movement.
