I'm curious how many people here have ever felt the cool eye of the State as a
gun was pointed at their heads? 

For a time I lived across the street from President Obama's "permanent"
residence in Chicago. I could look at his house 30 yards away from my 3rd floor
front porch. When he came into town, an ambulance would run overnight across
the street, men in suits would come and go. Even a firetruck showed up.  

(not really going to post this guys)

There's one evening in particular that let me know where I stood in the
American hierarchy. I was returning home to get something to bring back to my
girlfriend's condo, or some such, and I had brought a piece of mail to prove
that I lived within the roadblock radius of his house, whilst he was visiting.
The cop asked me for my ID and a piece of mail. Unfortunately I'd brought with
me a piece of mail from a previous address. He frowned and suggested I just
show him my keys. *As if only near Obama's house do you need keys to enter a
building!* I thought. *Fool!* I thought.

Halfway to my apartment the reason for his lackadaisical attitude became clear.
It didn't matter if I were set on doing harm to the President. I never would
have been able to pull a trigger with all the scopes trained on my temple. I
recall walking out one day after he left, and seeing the long eight-foot
briefcases - I wonder what those held? 

It was extremely disconcerting to walk unprotected in a place where there were
so many guns, guns that there to protect someone who was not you. 

This is in addition to the regular tech surveillance I'm sure I've been subject
to. I suppose his residence must be on the list of constitution-free zones, or
some such. I'd be very surprised if Google had managed to refuse a government
request - what was that reputed Eric Schmidt quotation "if you don't want the
government to know about it, we shouldn't know about it". 

I can't say I dislike the Secret Service. And if there were anyone to be
monitored, it would be someone who lived across the street.
