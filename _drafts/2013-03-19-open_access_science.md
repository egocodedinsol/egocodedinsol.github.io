Idea, curious re: feedback. According to Nature Publishing Group's permissions
advice to authors[0], authors may include works published in Nature in other
works in which they an author provided the publication in Nature is credited.
Six months after publication, they may put copies of the paper on their
personal webpages.

If I republish my research online in some public archive, does that count as my
own work? If so, there might be a legal workaround. Many researchers have
public webpages, but they can be difficult to track down, they're scattered,
and there's not always an incentive to maintain them. There are some fragmented
social networks for researchers, kind of like the ArXiv, but they lack the
social incentive.
