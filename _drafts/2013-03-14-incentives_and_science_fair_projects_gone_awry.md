Whenever we have punishments or other disincentives, we have to consider how
big the problem is, and how big the problem could be. Disincentives are used
when there is a significant risk of people behaving in a socially detrimental
manner. I could see this being an appropriate punishment if everyone at the
school were running around blowing stuff up, but not for an isolated
experience.

I have two explosion experiences to share. The first was when my siblings and a
couple friends placed dry ice in water bottles, then buried them in mole hills
just to see the dirt fly through the air like a war movie (what can I say, we
had aesthetic taste). My mother, concerned, asked her friend who worked at the
fire department to mail us an official notice to scare us.

The second was in high school. My friends made a cooler explode. This was very
poor judgement. Plastic shards flew everywhere. They flunked the lab they were
supposed to be working on. I think that response was appropriate. At least one
of them is a scientist now.

If we want to cultivate judgment the best way to do it is probably not through
making an example of someone.

fwiw, the officer's report seemed professional and nonjudgmental. He made sure
to indicate that she didn't expect a large explosion.
