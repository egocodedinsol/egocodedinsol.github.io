I haven't been in the field long enough to know whether this is a normal thing
or not, but one thing I feel frustrated by as a young person reading
scientific papers is the force with which extremely strong assertions seem
to be made. I'm afraid to single out any particular instances, because that
might imply that I think their conclusions are too weak to merit the titles of
their papers. It would imply that, but I'm not in a position to publicly air
my vague discontent. This is one reason I wish I'd have left this blog
anonymous. In an era in which data is still closed, relationships between
scientists matter quite a lot. <span id="lambda">&#x3BB;</span>
