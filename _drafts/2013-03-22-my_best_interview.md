I'd love to relay the best interview experience I've had: 

Aaron Goodman, data scientist at Custora (YC), saw a comment I made on HN and
sent me an email. 

When we spoke on the phone, he said one of the founders would be contacting
me, and after that, *we'd do a couple data analysis problems together* so he
could make sure "I didn't just know the lingo." 

When I spoke to a founder, Cory, he spent an hour explaining how startups
work, where they were (roughly) with runway and how they intended to use it,
how they chose investors, how their data scientist impacted their business. 

I later chose to go to graduate school, but this was not a reflection on them
at all (if I was still in the running). 

What impressed me the most was offering to do some work together. This was
awesome for two reasons. First, it showed that they weren't just out to hire
someone who did things they couldn't understand. Second, and unlike a "show me
you can do the fibonacci", it would have offered me a chance to see what it
would be like to work with Aaron. I didn't know him at all, so if I were going
to move to NY, I would want to be damn sure he wasn't a fool.
