I went to school near where Linus lives. I understand deeply the desire to
transfer schools or districts because I benefited from it. I was supposed to go
to one school (which Jen-Hsun Huang attended) but went to another because of
certain academic advantages including a hand-picked faculty (hey, it was a new
school in 2001, so my physics teacher had a PhD in chemistry and worked in
industry for many years before deciding to teach. My English teacher also had a
PhD. ). Many parents worked for Intel or Nike. Education was regarded as
incredibly important. He hits the nail on the head when he writes "But you do
also end up being in a community where people care about education, so it's not
just the school: it's the whole environment around you and your kids."
