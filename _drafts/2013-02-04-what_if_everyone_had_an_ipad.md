What if everyone owned an ipad? 

If everyone owned an ipad would print piracy die? 

I can go to nytimes.com, but if I had an ipad, I wouldn't necessarily be able
to do so.

What if everyone owns either a Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or iPad tablet?
Suppose one were more "open" - how many people would choose the open one?
