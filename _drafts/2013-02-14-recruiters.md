This was much more interesting than expected, since it came from a recruiter.
It got very good at the end where he mentioned that this specific incident
caused him to focus on differentiating his company: if many people are
reporting negative experiences with recruiters, there could really be a niche
for a candidate-focused one, provided the reputation is strong enough.

It might work particularly well if the effect recruiters can have on an
employee's reputation is emphasized. As an example, a friend of mine was once
contacted by a recruiter in the days when people still typed resumes. He said
"I'm an engineer, not a sales guy." The recruiter said "sure!" My friend said
"My resume's not up to date." The recruiter said "no problem, just hand edit
your typed resume, and our secretary will retype it for you!"

My friend walked into the interview, and the interviewer says "sooo, you want
to be in sales, do you?" My friend said "No, I specifically told the recruiter
no sales." The interviewer then pulled out the resume: my friend's original
typed version, complete with his scribbled edits. They had a good laugh and
ended up hitting it off well enough that he was offered an engineering job
anyway.

He was lucky, though: if the interviewer hadn't wanted a laugh by meeting the
sales guy who submitted a scribbly resume, his reputation could have been
tarnished, especially given how small his engineering field was.
