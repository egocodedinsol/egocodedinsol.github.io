No one wants to discuss innovation.  They want to innovate. Alas, some meta is
necessary in life. 

I have written this essay so that when I use the term in the future, I can send
someone to the exact specification of what I mean. 

I have also written this essay because too many potentially interesting
discussions deteriorate when one person asserts that X is not innovative, and
another person replies that X is certainly innovative, but they each mean
totally different things by "innovation". It's as if they both have macros at
the top of their cognitive space expanding the term "innovation" to different
words. Put another way, it's as if they both have filters assigning properties
of concepts in certain combinations to the class "innovative" but their filters
behave differently.  Discussions depend on a common set of definitions and
"innovation" seems to mean many things to many people. No one disagrees about
what SpaceX or GE or Bell Labs reference, but innovation seems to have
all sorts of connotations.  
 
[My favorite definition](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5353959) is
perhaps the least useful: Innovation is like pornography. You know what it's
not. This definition is so seductive because most people feel strongly about
whether a particular concept or idea is innovative, all the more so if they
care about being innovative themselves. 

Unfortunately, two people might see innovation differently. One person looks at
StackOverflow and says "Okay ... so they answer questions. You need what, a text
box on the front-end and a server?" Another person says: "Whoa, everyone debugs
and writes code differently now!" Another person says "Yes, but the technology
was already in place, it was a solved problem before they started it." Unlike
mathematics, language definitions are social truths, there's no theory that will
explain who has the right definition - if that were true, we'd never have
changing ones. 

But there are more immediately useful definitions. I'm going to suggest here
that we use the term innovation as "maximal change in a new dimension" because
it is the most useful, and because I have a direct analogy for it in my head
that's really simple: imagine an n-1 dimensional plane in an n-dimensional
linear space and embed it in an (n+1)-dimensional one. When someone innovates,
it's like they notice a new parameter to change by taking the normal to the
plane.  This is my favorite metaphor because it suggests an orientation as
well as a magnitude: you're pointing out a very different dimension, and
you're moving along it. It's not merely change: one wouldn't call repealing a
tax break innovative even though it would probably change society.
Conversely, one would not suggest that a new dimension to tax policy is
innovative unless it presents some large difference in the way society
behaves.



# Is innovation an embedding property? 

One of my favorite concepts from group theory is a normal subgroup.
Normality is an embedding property: N might be a normal subgroup of G, but not
H. In congrast, an Abelian group is Abelian regardless of whether it is a
subgroup of a non-Abelian group. Does a concept's innovativeness depend on the society,
organization, or market in which it is used or is it innovative only with
respect to other inventions? Does it matter that it's used at all? [Does it
depend on changing a mass-market?](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=291824)

Let's say I come up with a new method for making sugar appear whiter, but
everyone in the sugar industry dismisses it. Is it innovative? This is not just
a question of whether the tree fell in the forest if no one heard it. Clearly a
proof that P=NP would be no less innovative if only a handful of computer
scientists understood it. We might be tempted to claim that mathematics and
computer science are different beasts entirely, since proofs are eternal, so of
course their innovativeness does not depend on the social aspects. But in
general, proofs are social things! They're _meant_ to convince and clarify. So
even in the case of eternal beauty, innovativeness should not be an embedding
property.  




# Innovation is not complexity measure

My favorite legend of the sugar industry tells the story of a man with a most
valuable secret for making sugar appear whiter. In his land, having white sugar
was sought after more than anything. So he sold his idea to the king for a
Billion dollars with a capital B. The entire innovation was just blue paper on
the inside of the sugar bag. Blue makes whites appear brighter. All the other
sugar-whiteners were upset: "But he didn't do anything!" The chefs were
disdainful: "why was he trying to make sugar look whiter when he should be
focusing on the taste! Or better yet, new kinds of food!" Was this man
innovating? Yes: he found a new parameter to vary and it changed the entire
industry. Where before everyone had been fine-tuing one thing (the sugar
itself), he noted that you could get the same result by changing something else
entirely (the packaging). 



# How to measure <strike>innovation</strike> usefulness

[Everyone](http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/blog/31329/) seems to be
[writing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5353452) about 
[measurement](http://samaltman.posthaven.com/growth-and-government) lately.
Since I envisage innovation as something big and new, it makes sense to consider
how to actually tell how innovative something is. Can we map from some set of
properties about a given concept to an "innovation index?" Less strongly, given
a set of concepts, can I impose a partial ordering on them? 

I think this is the wrong approach. A better approach is to stop trying to
measure innovation, and just ask which innovations are more useful. Usefulness
is much easier to measure. On the other hand, it certainly it can be dangerously
shortsighted. If we agree that ease of measurement is a nice property, we might
notice that immediate usefulness is much easier to measure accurately than
future usefulness, and miss things like Fourier analysis or nuclear physics,
initiated before they became useful. 

And it is certainly contextual - useful to whom? What is useful to you is not
useful to me, necessarily. This much is obvious, but it leads to a far more
subtle question of how to measure usefulness in a system with multiple agents.
This is what people are probably most upset about when they see investments go
toward things they call "less innovative." They mean less useful to society now
or in an expected way down the road. 

The bias of immediacy and contextual relevance combine in an unfortunate
manner: the Turing Machine was not immediately useful to most people,
but it was useful to almost everyone in the future through the other concepts or
products it made possible. 

Include figures about how innovativeness sometimes also includes spreading risk
of usefulness. Something that is immediately useful is often less risky.
something that is useful only in the future probably has a huge uncertainty
associated with it. 





# The relationship between usefulness and innovation

Usefulness and innovation are not quite the same. The discovery of a large oil
deposit is not innovative, but it is useful. On the other hand, the discovery
of a new technique of oil extraction could be. 


Think of the conflicts humans usually faces in novels: "man versus man", "man
versus nature", "man versus himself". For much of what we traditionally
consider innovation, there's man versus nature: we can fly, we can go to the
moon, we can build power plants and subway tunnels. With biology, we've been
looking toward man versus himself recently. You might consider penicillin a
triumph of man over nature, but that changes when you start to fight aging. 

The biggest prize, though, is "man 'versus' man". Facebook and Reddit and
Google and Twitter are four such innovations. YCombinator is one. In some
sense, these are the most striking innovations since they change the way people
interact with eachother. Human conflicts are what are recorded in history. It
may not be the most immediately lucrative, but over time I think it might be
the most powerful. 





### Innovation is more than techology

Some of the most innovative changes are social, not technological. StackOverflow
presents my favorite example. 

### Innovation doesn't talk about itself

The more I hear something talk about how innovative it is, the more I run and
hide. Self-reference is the cool when Douglas Hofstadter does it, not because
he's cool, but because he doesn't use it to tell everyone how awesome he is. 












This is unhelpful, because it would be remarkably innefficient to consider
every possible new idea, and decide if it's "not innovative." It would probably
work, but it would take several boring, uninnovative hours.  

Perhaps a better method is to skirt around the definition, and [ask
instead](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5353452) "What is the right way to
measure innovation?" Even here, we risk running down the rabbit hole of meta.
How will we know when we have the "right" way - "what is the correct way to
decide the right way to measure innovation?" I'm going to deliberately avoid the
problem and say "a right way to measure innovation is a useful way." Usefulness
is a lot easier to define than correctness, and it tolerates a lot more
vagueness without sacrificing as much meaning.  Further, useful is easy because
we only need a definition that's useful right now, while we're discussing
something, not useful in the future. 




## What is a useful measure innovation?

### A useful measure of innovation should not be black and white

We often speak of "innovation" in terms of X being "more innovative" than Y.
Therefore it makes good sense to have some [analog
measure](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5353959), or at least a partially
ordered set. 




### Useful measures discriminate

Any measure is useless if it does not distingiush anything. If a partial ordering
just returns == for any two values, it's not useful.




### Useful measures map new projects to a non-negative value

Regardless of _how_ innovative, new ideas are certainly not <em>un</em>innovative. I'm
also not interested in considering how "uninnovative" person or organization X
is.  




### Useful measures 

A useful measure of innovation tells new from old

A useful measure of innovation tells beneficial from unbeneficial. 


I'm not claiming we should start seeing Instagram as the most innovative
company ever. But we should start to consider that not all innovation comes in
the form of "new technology." Yes, we all know innovation is not equal to
hovercrafts. What we forget to do is note that the absence of hovercrafts is
not an extremely strong signal that innovation has stalled. At some point the
most innovative things are hard to see as innovative. There's definitely a
time lag there. The joke used to be that the microcomputer's impact was
everywhere but the labor productivity statistics. 

And once a new technology is assimilated into society, uses of it cease to be
associated with that technology specifically. This will happen when web
companies stop calling themselves _web_ companies. You're not a web company
because you use the internet, javascript, or html, any more than a chimney
sweeping company is a tech company just because they have a website, too. This
is okay. Your users probably don't care that you're "distrupting the
chimney-sweep space," they just want the chimney swept promptly, courteously,
and with less mess than the other guy. If you focus on your audience, you'll
probably do better. <span id="lambda">&#x3BB;</span>
