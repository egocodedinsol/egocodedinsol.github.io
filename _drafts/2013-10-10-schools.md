Assuming that schools *are* the problem, the answer might not be "fix schools"
but to change incentive structures which drive students to take less seriously
whatever curiosity-killing advice school gives. My contention would be to offer
alternative credentialing mechanisms. A poor student who has distinguished
herself in other ways might be freed from having to wholeheartedly embrace a
harmful mindset to get ahead.
