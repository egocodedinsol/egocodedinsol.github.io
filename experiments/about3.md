This is a collection of anonymous essays. The point of anonymity is not so
much to "speak truth to power" but to avoid self-promotion. The point of
avoiding self-promotion is to create better essays. I couldn't put it better
than [Adam
Kirsch](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112307/essay-reality-television-david-sedaris-davy-rothbart):

_The essayist is concerned, as a fiction writer is not, with what the reader
will think of him or her. That is why the new comic essayists are never truly
confessional, and never intentionally reveal anything that might jeopardize
the reader’s esteem. “Love me” is their all-but-explicit plea._

I study computational neursocience with <a
href='http://pondside.uchicago.edu/oba/faculty/Hatsopoulos/lab/index.html'>Nicholas
G. Hatsopolos</a> and <a
href='http://pondside.uchicago.edu/oba/faculty/ross_c.html'>Callum F.
Ross</a>. With the Hatsopoulos Lab, I am currently studying the dynamics of
motor cortex in primate reaching and grasping via propagating local field
potential waves and their interaction/covariation with spiking. With Dr. Ross,
I am investigating the role of primary motor and somatosensory cortices in
feeding behavior.

Things I like: clever things, elegant things, and messy things. I particularly
enjoy transformations between them, like elegant approaches to noisy, high
dimensional data, verbose papers with precise conclusions, and beautiful data
visualizations.

I am looking to attend graduate school in the Fall of 2013. I have so far
worked only within the realm of motor control with Utah arrays in cortex.
However, I am open to working within other frameworks, so long as the data is
rich enough and the question complex enough.
